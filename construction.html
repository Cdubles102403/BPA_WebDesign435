            <h3>Geothermal Energy</h3>
                <p>There are a multitude of ways of harvesting geothermal energy such as using dry steam. Dry steam is a process by that of which underground collections of steam are piped from wells to a turbine. Annother method would be using flash steam. Flash steam differs from dry steam as it uses water from reservoirs with temperatures that reach up to 182째C or 360째F that is pumped to the surface. The water, after reaching the surface, is allowed to boil into steam allowing the steam to power turbines as is such with the dry steam method. Any leftover water is pumped back into the reservoir. A binary steam system also uses water, but it can be used at a much lower temperature. Binary steam uses the energy from water to heat annother liquid such as isobutene which has a lower boiling point that water. The secondary liquid, also known as the working fluid, is heated into steam that powers a turbine. The original water can then be pumped back into the ground to be reheated.</p>
                <p>Opposed to simply creating electricity, you can also use geothermal heat pumps to manage the temperature of the surface. Dispite the fact that the surface temperature changes seasonally, below the surface, the temperature is fairly consistent arround 50째F - 60째F year round. One method is using a closed loop system of which there are three different types. One such type is a vertical system where water is pumped in a circulaory system downwards into the ground to be warmed, and then brought back up to be exchanged with colder water. Annother system is a horizontal system where water is pumped into the ground, but is then coiled to maximize the energy gathered. This is more useful is you are unable to pipe water to such depths as the vertical system would require. The other closed loop system is the pond or lake system. In this system, water is pumped into a large heated body of water, however it is still contained within the pipes of the circular system. The open loop system however differes from the pond or lake cloesed loop system as it pumps water directly into the water and exchanges it for other water that is pumped from that same body.</p>
                <p>Harvesting the geothermal energy necessary to power you home would be dificult as you would have to be on a location that has access to geothermal energy. Typically these would be near tectonically active regions as they require the generation of high temperature resources. However the geothermal heat pumps are available practically everywhere as the underground temperature stays the same through seasons and only changes with location and depth.</p>
